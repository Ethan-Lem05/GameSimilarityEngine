Unite with 20 million Guardians in the fight to defend our universe and Become Legend.","Prior to the events of The Taken King, Guardians crippled the Hive invasion force on Earth and the Moon by methodically taking down their field commanders and strategists, including Sardon and Omnigul. The Guardians then banished Crota's soul and eventually killed Crota himself. They also destroyed a Shrine communing with Oryx and killed its protector, Sardok.

Eris Morn alerted Mara Sov of Oryx's arrival, and the Queen set out with the Awoken Armada to Saturn, where the Taken King's Dreadnaught had stopped to refuel. Uldren Sov led his fighter wings to attack the Dreadnaught and engage the fleet of Tombships protecting it, with the Queen and Oryx presiding over the battle from their respective flagships.

With help from her Coven of Techeun Witches, the Queen summoned her Harbingers, deadly orbs that could decimate an army in seconds. The Harbingers bombarded the Dreadnaught, but after the explosions faded away there seemed to be no lasting marks on the battlecruiser. Oryx then fired the ship's superweapon, which ripped a hole through the rings of Saturn and completely destroyed the Awoken fleet. Queen Mara and many other major parts of the Reef's leadership, including Paladin Abra Zire and Techeun Shuro Chi, have since disappeared and are considered MIA, while Petra Venj has advised a remaining Paladin to declare all of them dead.

Attack on Phobos
Meanwhile, the Vanguard intercepted a distress signal on all channels, broadcasted from the Skyburners fortress Fleetbase Korus on Phobos. A Guardian is dispatched to Phobos, and they witness a strange new enemy slaughtering the Skyburners. Oryx contacts the Guardians, willing into existence an army of corrupted Cabal and Hive called the Taken. The Guardian defeats these Taken, overcoming Syrok, Word of Oryx. They then attempt to escape the Skyburner Keep via the Aerodrome landing pad, which is riddled with Taken. The Guardian reaches the landing pad and escapes Phobos in their ship.

From then, Oryx's master plan is revealed: He will enslave as many Cabal, Vex, Fallen, and his own Hive as he can, and use them to bring the system into ruin. Initially, one of his consorts, Ecthar (who also fluently speaks English), tells him to only retrieve the strongest of the four races and bring the rest to nigh-extinction, but Oryx objects to Ecthar's advice.

Realizing that the Taken are too deadly a threat to take lightly, the Vanguard send Guardians to rediscover lost powers of their forebearers. The Hunter gains the Nightstalker class and the Shadowshot super ability, the Warlock gains the Stormcaller class and the Stormtrance super ability, and the Titan gains the Sunbreaker class and the Hammer of Sol super ability.","Action, Science fiction, Warfare",rpg elements,"Shooter, Role-playing (RPG)",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co30dq.jpg,,"http://www.destinythegame.com/, https://www.twitch.tv/bungie, https://www.youtube.com/user/destinygame/home, https://www.facebook.com/DestinyTheGame, https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame, https://www.instagram.com/destinythegame, https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/The_Taken_King_(Expansion), https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny:_The_Taken_King"

Complete your experience with the explosive finale to the Arkham series in Batman: Arkham Knight. Become the Batman and utilize a wide range of gadgets and abilities to face off against Gotham's most dangerous villains, finally facing the ultimate threat against the city that Batman is sworn to protect.","Batman: Arkham Asylum
The game begins with Batman escorting the Joker in the Batmobile to Arkham Asylum after catching him at Gotham City Hall.

The situation at City Hall took place at the exact same time as a 'mysterious fire' at Blackgate Prison, causing many of the prisoners to be sent to Arkham, among them a great number of Joker's own gang. When the two arrive at Arkham, Batman and several helmeted security guards strap the Joker to an upright stretcher and wheel him down into the Intensive Treatment Center. Batman accompanies the security personnel and the Joker to the Holding Cells, where the Arkham staff refuse to let Batman go any further. As the Joker is being registered into the Cell Block by Commissioner Gordon, he breaks free from a guard and escapes from Batman with the help of Harley Quinn. Batman, who is locked out of the area, breaks into the Holding Cells through a glass window. Once Batman is inside the Holding Cells area the Joker springs his first trap, unlocking the cells and allowing Blackgate convicts to flood out to attack Batman. After another brief confrontation with more convicts, the Joker deactivates a security gate, allowing Batman to follow after him despite Commissioner Gordon's observation that it was most likely a trap. Batman moves up a ramp in the direction of the Joker's escape, leaving the Holding Cells and entering the Processing Corridor, finding the hallway littered with fallen security guards the Joker left in his wake. He found one guard that had survived named Eddie Burlow, who points him to the Lower Corridor. Batman reaches the Patient Pacification Chamber, where two security guards inform him that escaped inmate Victor Zsasz has taken another guard, Mike, hostage and will kill him if he sees Batman get close to him. Batman subsequently subdues Zsasz after swooping down from a gargoyle. All of a sudden, Batman receives a message from Harley Quinn, who has taken Quincy Sharp, the warden, hostage. Although Quinn is convinced Batman is trapped in Patient Pacification, Batman escapes back to the Processing Corridor, moving into the Decontamination area, where several Arkham personnel and inmates were trapped in a room filling with Joker Toxin.

Batman: Arkham City
Prologue
New Arkham City inmate and rising warlord, Two-Face devises a plan to publicly execute fellow prisoner Catwoman after she tries to steal back some of her ill-gotten gains from his hideout. Meanwhile, Gotham City itself has degenerated into a police state managed by Mayor Sharp, where citizens with the slightest trace of a criminal record find themselves shipped to the prison district. Those who dare to challenge Sharp's policies are the target of arranged disappearances, becoming political prisoners trapped behind Arkham's walls. Among these is Bruce Wayne, who holds a rally attacking the proposal of turning half his city into a walled-off reserve for criminally inclined persons. Segregated from society, he argues, they have become responsible for their own survival in an anarchic urban hell which is characterized by bloody gang wars.

Welcome to Arkham City
Wayne, as the latest focus of Sharp's vendetta, is kidnapped by TYGER Security operatives working for Hugo Strange, who is privy to his dual identity as Batman. Strange intends to unveil new plans for Arkham City before the night is up, an operation codenamed Protocol 10, which will establish himself as supreme ruler of Gotham. Now an inmate, the Dark Knight manages to have Alfred Pennyworth deliver his crimefighting equipment to him directly via an airdrop, and he prepares to save Catwoman from Two-Face for the sake of their past relationship while uncovering the true nature of Protocol 10.

Batman: Arkham Knight
Prologue
Nine months after the |Joker's death, crime rates in Gotham City have dramatically declined, but Batman anticipates a new threat and maintains a vigil over the city. Before his death, the Joker sent his mutated blood to Gotham's hospitals, and several patients were infected. While most were cured, the patients who were not treated are starting to look and act like the Joker. Batman researches a cure for the mutations, and orders Robin to watch over the infected.

The Arkham Knight
On Halloween night, Scarecrow unleashes his newest strain of Fear Gas in a diner, and threatens to release it throughout Gotham. Six million civilians are evacuated, but the city's criminals and supervillains stay behind, leaving Commissioner James Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department outnumbered. Batman investigates Scarecrow's presence, and searches for him in a rooftop safehouse, but instead finds and saves Poison Ivy, who was being held captive by Scarecrow's henchmen. In a makeshift Batcave in Gotham's Clock Tower, Barbara Gordon is collecting information on Scarecrow's new toxin, and traces its production to Ace Chemicals. Batman goes to investigate, but is confronted by the mysterious ""Arkham Knight"" and his militia, which has a massive army of unmaned tanks. Batman fights his way through the militia, learning from workers that Scarecrow is planning to produce a chemical explosion so large that it will cover the entire eastern seaboard in fear toxin. Batman reaches Scarecrow, who reveals to him that Barbara has been abducted by the Arkhan Knight before escaping. While reducing the blast radius, Batman is exposed to the fear toxin, which reacts with his own mutated blood to cause hallucinations of the Joker. Escaping from the exploding Ace Chemicals, Batman is forced to tell Gordon about his daughter's involvement in his crime-fighting, and the outraged Gordon swears that he will find Barbara without Batman's help.

Scarecrow's Plans
Batman tracks the Arkham Knight to an underground tunnel network, hoping to learn Barbara's whereabouts from him, but instead gets ambushed by him. Batman then gives chase to the escaping convoy, only to learn that the driver is a decoy, using a voice synthesizer that makes him sound like the Arkham Knight. Batman interrogates the driver and learns that they are heading to the North Refrigeration. He and Nightwing interrogate the Penguin, who tells them that the Knight and Scarecrow are meeting with a businessman named Simon Stagg, who runs a pharmaceutical company. After boarding Stagg's airship, Batman discovers that Scarecrow paid Stagg to create a device known as the ""Cloudburst"", but Stagg tried to double-cross them and has been doused with fear toxin as punishment. After reaching Scarecrow and interrogating Stagg, Batman is again exposed to the toxin, which triggers a powerful hallucinogenic response. Scarecrow escapes with the Cloudburst. Batman receives a message from Scarecrow revealing that Barbara is in the same safehouse where Ivy was held, but before Batman can save her, Barbara is doused with fear toxin and shoots herself in the head.

The kingdom has fallen and its people have moved on.

Five generations after the defeat of the Maelstrom a new King was born. So loved was he that the royal family was once again granted merit in the political system of Llylgamyn. Eventually the council decided to dissolve and to restore exclusive rulership royal family.

It was not long for the true colors of the King to shine through. Rumors quickly spread throughout the kingdom of his alliance with demonic beings, and his dabble in the dark arts. His queen was whispered to be a perverse harlot, torturing men of the kingdom for her own pleasure. In an attempt to gain more power, the King joined forces with an unknown wizard. Together they began to wage magical war on other planes of existence. During one of their battles they became aware of an artifact of amazing power.

The Cosmic Forge.

The Cosmic Forge is a magical pen of divine power. No one is sure of it's origin, but it is said then whatever words were written with the pen would we woven into the fabric of the universe, and thus would become reality.

The King and the Wizard managed to obtain the pen, they scripted things so unspeakable that no man can attempt to even imagine the horrors. Fortunately the two soon became jealous of the power that they had discovered, and they engaged each other in an epic battle.

Legends say that the lights of magic could be seen flashing in the windows of the castle, and the very ground shook. Eventually everything fell quiet, and neither the King nor the wizard were seen again.

In the explosive finale to the Arkham series, The Scarecrow returns to unite an impressive roster of super villains, including Penguin, Two-Face and Harley Quinn. Batman: Arkham Knight introduces Rocksteady's Batmobile, which is drivable for the first time in the franchise. This legendary vehicle combined with the acclaimed gameplay of the Batman Arkham series, offers gamers the ultimate Batman experience as they tear through Gotham City.

This season pass for Batman: Arkham Knight features new story missions, more supervillains invading Gotham City, new legendary Batmobiles, advanced challenge maps, alternative character skins, and new drivable race tracks.","Prologue
Nine months after the |Joker's death, crime rates in Gotham City have dramatically declined, but Batman anticipates a new threat and maintains a vigil over the city. Before his death, the Joker sent his mutated blood to Gotham's hospitals, and several patients were infected. While most were cured, the patients who were not treated are starting to look and act like the Joker. Batman researches a cure for the mutations, and orders Robin to watch over the infected.

The Arkham Knight
On Halloween night, Scarecrow unleashes his newest strain of Fear Gas in a diner, and threatens to release it throughout Gotham. Six million civilians are evacuated, but the city's criminals and supervillains stay behind, leaving Commissioner James Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department outnumbered. Batman investigates Scarecrow's presence, and searches for him in a rooftop safehouse, but instead finds and saves Poison Ivy, who was being held captive by Scarecrow's henchmen. In a makeshift Batcave in Gotham's Clock Tower, Barbara Gordon is collecting information on Scarecrow's new toxin, and traces its production to Ace Chemicals. Batman goes to investigate, but is confronted by the mysterious ""Arkham Knight"" and his militia, which has a massive army of unmaned tanks. Batman fights his way through the militia, learning from workers that Scarecrow is planning to produce a chemical explosion so large that it will cover the entire eastern seaboard in fear toxin. Batman reaches Scarecrow, who reveals to him that Barbara has been abducted by the Arkhan Knight before escaping. While reducing the blast radius, Batman is exposed to the fear toxin, which reacts with his own mutated blood to cause hallucinations of the Joker. Escaping from the exploding Ace Chemicals, Batman is forced to tell Gordon about his daughter's involvement in his crime-fighting, and the outraged Gordon swears that he will find Barbara without Batman's help.

Scarecrow's Plans
Batman tracks the Arkham Knight to an underground tunnel network, hoping to learn Barbara's whereabouts from him, but instead gets ambushed by him. Batman then gives chase to the escaping convoy, only to learn that the driver is a decoy, using a voice synthesizer that makes him sound like the Arkham Knight. Batman interrogates the driver and learns that they are heading to the North Refrigeration. He and Nightwing interrogate the Penguin, who tells them that the Knight and Scarecrow are meeting with a businessman named Simon Stagg, who runs a pharmaceutical company. After boarding Stagg's airship, Batman discovers that Scarecrow paid Stagg to create a device known as the ""Cloudburst"", but Stagg tried to double-cross them and has been doused with fear toxin as punishment. After reaching Scarecrow and interrogating Stagg, Batman is again exposed to the toxin, which triggers a powerful hallucinogenic response. Scarecrow escapes with the Cloudburst. Batman receives a message from Scarecrow revealing that Barbara is in the same safehouse where Ivy was held, but before Batman can save her, Barbara is doused with fear toxin and shoots herself in the head. Batman and Alfred Pennyworth are devastated, but Alfred convinces Batman to not lose hope, for Barbara's sake. Alfred explains to Batman that the Cloudburst is a dispersal device designed to flood all of Gotham with the fear toxin.

11226,Anstoss 3,"2000 wurde mit Anstoss 3 die zweite Fortsetzung veröffentlicht. Innerhalb eines Jahres verkaufte es sich mehr als 200.000 Mal. Von den Spielemagazinen wurde es mit guten Wertungen bedacht (z. B. PC Player 87 %, Gamestar 88 %, PC Games 86 %).
Jedoch war es zu Beginn geradezu gefüllt mit Bugs, was von der Spielergemeinde kritisiert wurde. Dennoch wurde es von den Anstoss-Fans mit Begeisterung aufgenommen, da es die wichtigsten Elemente von Anstoss 2 Gold enthielt und diese noch weiter vertiefen konnte.
Als besonders gelungen gilt die 3D-Spieldarstellung. Der Spieler konnte sich ein komplettes Spiel seines Teams reduziert auf neun Minuten ansehen. Auch der Szenenmodus galt als revolutionär, da die Szenen nicht, wie in den Vorgängerteilen, vorberechnet wurden. Kommentiert wurden die Spielszenen durch den bekannten Fußballkommentator Günther Koch.
Auch neu war die Umsetzung des Vereinsgeländes. Von Apfelbäumen über Konditionsparcours und Doping-Labor bis hin zu Wolkenkratzern konnte der Spieler sein Vereinsgelände mit Gebäuden, Gegenständen und Lebewesen mit und ohne Nutzen erweitern.
Mit der Veröffentlichung des finalen Patches auf Version 1.40 wurde es nahezu bugfrei und konnte die Anstoss-Spieler überzeugen. Insgesamt wurden bis heute über eine Million Exemplare von Anstoss 3 verkauft und machen es damit zu einem der erfolgreichsten PC-Spiele Deutschlands. Trotz seines Alters wird Anstoss 3 durch die große Spieltiefe zusammen mit einem gelungenen Text- und 3D-Modus als bester Teil der Anstoss-Reihe angesehen. Dass Anstoss 3 auch heute noch sehr beliebt ist, hängt auch mit dem Multiplayermodus zusammen.

She informs Geralt that Emperor Emhyr has summoned him to the city of Vizima. There, Emhyr tasks Geralt with finding Ciri, who has been recently spotted in various locations. Ciri is a Child of the Elder Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that bestows her with the power to manipulate space and time.

Geralt first follows clues that Ciri was in Velen at Crow's Perch, the fort of the Bloody Baron. The Baron refuses to help, but Geralt's acquaintance, sorceress Keira Metz, informs him that an Elven mage, Avallac'h, was searching for Ciri. Keira directs Geralt to the Crones of Crookback Bog, malicious, ancient spirits residing near Velen. The Crones reveal that they had captured Ciri for the Wild Hunt before she escaped, and that they have enslaved the Baron's missing wife, Anna. After determining Anna's fate, Geralt returns to the Baron who tells him that Ciri went to Novigrad.

Arriving in Novigrad, Geralt discovers that the Church of the Eternal Fire, a militant religious organization, is purging mages in the city. Rendezvousing with his former lover, Triss Merigold, Geralt learns that Ciri had contacted his friend Dandelion. Geralt navigates Novigrad's criminal underworld to rescue Dandelion, and discovers that Ciri teleported to the Skellige archipelago. While in Novigrad, Geralt may assist Triss in liberating fugitive mages.

After sailing to Skellige, Geralt reunites with Yennefer, who has been investigating a magical explosion linked to Ciri. The pair track Ciri's movements to the island of Lofoten and learn the Wild Hunt have attacked it. Following clues, they realise that Uma, a deformed, cursed creature at Crow's Perch, was present following Ciri's escape. Before leaving Skellige, Geralt can help determine who will become the leader of Skellige following the king's death. Yennefer chooses to sever the magical bond that draws her and Geralt together, giving him the option to willingly affirm his love for her or end their relationship.

The pair recover Uma to the abandoned witcher school of Kaer Morhen where Yennefer successfully removes Uma's curse, transforming him into Avallac'h. He reveals that he teleported Ciri to the Isle of Mists to save her from the Lofoten attack. Geralt travels to the Isle and finds Ciri in a deathlike state until she is awakened by Avallac'h's magic. Ciri reveals that the King of the Wild Hunt, Eredin's homeworld is being destroyed by a plight known as the White Frost, and he wants Ciri's power in order to conquer the Continent. Ciri and Geralt teleport to Kaer Morhen pursued by the Wild Hunt. After a brief reunion with Yennefer, Triss, and their witcher mentor Vesemir, the Hunt attacks. Vesemir is killed protecting Ciri and her distress causes her to uncontrollably unleash her Elder power leading Eredin and the Hunt to retreat. Geralt, Yennefer, Triss, Ciri, and their allies then hold a funeral for Vesemir.

Ciri and Geralt travel to Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid in their fight. They also learn about the Sunstone, a relic that can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan isle of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, before Geralt faces Eredin in combat and emerges victorious. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. Ciri enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat.

The ending varies depending on choices made throughout the game. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with either Yennefer or Triss, or remain a lone Witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and took Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become Empress, believing it the best way to positively affect the world; if Ciri doesn't meet the Emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a Witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake, but is surrounded by monsters upon its discovery, leaving his fate ambiguous.","Action, Fantasy, Historical, Open world",,"Role-playing (RPG), Adventure",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co1wz4.jpg,98.32259009549341,"http://thewitcher.com, http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt, https://www.facebook.com/thewitcher, https://twitter.com/, https://instagram.com/cdpred, https://www.youtube.com/user/WitcherGame, https://store.steampowered.com/sub/124923, https://www.gog.com/game/the_witcher_3_wild_hunt_game_of_the_year_edition, https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt, https://www.twitch.tv/cdprojektred, https://discord.gg/thewitcher"

In a time long forgotten, the Regal Realms existed in perfect harmony, guarded by the immortal Council of the Elements. This council was composed of divine beings and legendary heroes from every corner of the world, entrusted with the sacred duty of maintaining the balance between life, death, and the elements—Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, and Ether. These mighty guardians hailed from different cultures and mythologies, bound by a shared purpose to protect the realm from chaos.

But the balance was not meant to last forever. A mysterious force, known only as the Shadow of Dusk, crept into the realms, sowing discord among the council members. Ancient alliances were shattered, and once-loyal guardians turned on each other, driven by their desire to harness the boundless power of the Regal Realms for themselves.

With the council fractured, the world descended into chaos. Powerful beings from Indian epics, African folklore, Southeast Asian myths, Arabian tales, and Latin American legends rose to stake their claim to the throne of the Regal Realms. Deities, warriors, and mythical creatures from every corner of the world now battle for dominion, each seeking to shape the realms in their image.

In the midst of this war-torn world, the last surviving champions of the Old Order gather to fight for the salvation of the Regal Realms. These warriors, drawn from the myths and legends of diverse cultures, are the last hope to restore the balance. But only one can emerge victorious.

As a player, you are called to summon and command these legendary figures. From the strength of Hanuman, the Indian divine warrior, to the cunning of Anansi, the African trickster god, and the wisdom of Quetzalcoatl, the Latin American serpent deity, you will build your army and lead them into battle. Using a deck of cards that grants you control over troops, spells, and weapons, you must defend your tower and strike down your opponents in a series of epic battles.

The fate of the Regal Realms rests in your hands. Will you restore balance to the world, or will you become the new ruler of the shattered realms, reshaping it according to your will?

Hanks’ life has been a relentless battle, not just against the undead but also against Moon, a ruthless leader of a formidable group that extorts and terrorizes other camps. As tensions rise and resources dwindle, alliances will be tested, and the fight for survival will intensify. Navigate the perilous forest, make strategic decisions, and uncover the dark secrets of this post-apocalyptic world.","The Enigma of MOON

In the chaotic aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, when hope seemed all but lost, a new threat emerged from the shadows—Moon , a ruthless and enigmatic figure who would come to dominate the forest landscape. His origins shrouded in mystery, Moon’s true identity remained a closely guarded secret, hidden behind a mask that concealed his every feature.

Amassing a formidable band of loyal followers, Moon quickly established himself as a force to be reckoned with. His modus operandi was simple yet effective: he would target the weaker camps, extorting their precious resources through a combination of intimidation and brute force. Moon’s insatiable thirst for power and control knew no bounds, and he would stop at nothing to maintain his dominance over the forest.

Hanks, the resolute leader of Camp One, was among the first to recognize the imminent danger posed by Moon . A seasoned military veteran, Hanks had honed his survival skills in the wilderness, and he understood the importance of unity and resilience in the face of such a formidable adversary. Yet, even as he harbored a deep-seated enmity towards Moon , Hanks remained uncertain about the true extent of his rival’s resources and capabilities

Moon’s true strength lay not only in his physical prowess and the loyalty of his followers but also in the veil of secrecy that shrouded his every move. He was a master of deception, always keeping his face hidden behind the mask, and his subordinates were fiercely devoted to maintaining his anonymity. This aura of mystery only served to amplify Moon’s reputation, striking fear into the hearts of those who dared to challenge his authority.

As Hanks and his camp struggled to maintain their fragile existence, the threat of Moon loomed ever larger. The conflict between the two leaders had become a battle of wits, with Hanks constantly seeking ways to outmaneuver his elusive foe. Yet, with Moon’s resources and influence growing by the day, the stakes had never been higher, and the fate of the forest – and perhaps even the remnants of humanity – hung in the balance.","Horror, Survival","zombies, survival mode, zombie survival, zombie shooter, zombie apocalypse",Shooter,//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co8c6f.jpg,95.14242878560721,"https://10nstudio.com/, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgmdkjlW0OkuCwUqngXr5wQ, https://twitter.com/huntermoonstrik, https://www.instagram.com/hunter_moonstrike/"

21324,Star Realms,"Star Realms is a card-based deck building science-fiction tabletop game, designed by Rob Dougherty and Darwin Kastle and published in 2014 by Wise Wizard Games. The game started out as a Kickstarter campaign in 2013. The goal of Star Realms is to destroy your opponent or opponents by purchasing cards using ""trade"" points and using these cards to attack your opponent's ""authority"" using your ""combat"" points. The game takes place in a distant future where different races compete to gain resources, trade and outmaneuver each other in a race to become ruler of the galaxy.

Star Realms is similar to other deck building games, like Ascension and Dominion.","Many centuries ago the human race began to colonize worlds other than Earth. An exploding population combined with an international hunger for the untapped resources of new worlds led to mankind’s rapid expansion beyond Earth’s solar system and out into the rest of the galaxy. The desirability of potential colony worlds varied widely based on location, natural resources, atmosphere, size, etc. Not surprisingly, this led to tensions and even outright conflict between interested parties, whether they were nations, corporations or other organizations.
This led to the militarization of human space. Given the great distances involved and evolving political landscapes and interests, many colonial governments changed. Some shifted allegiances based on common cause or common interest, while many formed independent governments. Of course the driving forces behind most of these changes were the same as ever: money and safety. Those with enough money formed organized space navies; initially this was for protection and influence over each other.
Then the Blobs came.

It’s not clear what first drew the hostile attention of these mysterious aliens, but most historians agree that it was in some way triggered by the non-stop expansion of human space, presumably towards Blob territory. While little was known about the organization and political structure of the Blobs at the time, they clearly had a united purpose as regarded humanity. Unfortunately for humanity, they were unprepared to present a united front against a major outside threat like the Blobs.

First contact with the Blobs came in the form of several of humanity’s outer colonies being completely obliterated by fleets of mysterious organic looking ships armed with weaponry that was far superior to that of the fledging regional human space navies. As various colony worlds and political entities sought protection and aid from their more powerful and better equipped trade partners in the human core worlds, they were disappointed with the response.
The great distances involved, long standing political differences and short sighted corporate greed resulted in little support from the core worlds, which were now ruled by a single corporate empire, which was more focused on profits than on human lives. Indeed, news of the alien threat caused further escalation and expansion of the core worlds’ space military, but little to none of it was sent to the aid of the outer worlds that were under the greatest threat of Blob attack.

It was about this time that history saw the rise of a planetary administrator turned warlord, Pierre Martine. Martine had already organized one of the biggest and most modernized space navies in the outer colonies, but his rise to power spiked dramatically with the arrival of the Blob menace. Now smaller colonies became quick to swear allegiance to Martine in return for a unified defense from the Blobs.
While independent outer colonies continued to get wiped out by the silent and brutal Blobs, the worlds protected by fleets of Martine’s rapidly expanding space navy were largely avoided by the dreaded alien ships. This only added to the rush to swear allegiance to Martine and his rapidly expanding empire. Soon over a third of human space was under his “protection”, which he formalized into the “Star Empire” with the announcement of his assuming the title of Emperor Martine. In just a few decades, Martine had become the sole ruler of far more territory and subjects than anyone in human history.

The Star Empire continued as a united empire under his oldest son, Lucien. Pierre Martine was a brilliant administrator and strategist as well as a long term thinker. He balanced the needs of the various worlds under his control, while at the same time ensuring his planetary governors all understood they owed him their complete loyalty and fealty. He raised Lucien with an understanding of the principles and strategy needed to keep the empire intact and even thriving, if not continuing to expand. Rather than waiting for his death to leave the question of leadership in doubt, Pierre chose to retire when he felt Lucien was ready to rule, thus providing a smooth transition.
While the outer worlds of humanity all came to be ruled by a single individual, the government of the core worlds was quite different. What started out as an alliance of nations from Earth trying to colonize into space, quickly became replaced by an alliance of wealthy corporations, as nations became unable to finance the rapid expansion out into the galaxy. In space the naval and economic might of corporations quickly dwarfed and then replaced that of the former Earth-based political entities. Without a political entity powerful enough to stop mergers and monopolies in space, these corporations eventually formed a united corporate empire that controlled the majority of human space. This was called the Trade Federation.

For many decades human historians viewed the galaxy as being completely divided up between these three groups: the Blobs, the Star Empire and the Trade Federation. What they didn’t realize was that there was a fourth major force gathering power in the galaxy: the Machine Cult. The Machine Cult started as an alliance between two major mining and manufacturing colonies that had been cut off from the rest of human space when the Blobs began hostilities with humanity. No human researchers know for certain why these two colonies survived initially, when similar colonies were being eradicated by the Blobs, but the colonists didn’t wait around hoping for their luck to hold.
The head of the industrial workers union on the two allied colonies, Thor Bowerson, led a movement that preached that they were a chosen people due to their survival. He preached that they had been abandoned by the rest of humanity and that they had no choice by to embrace their industry if they hoped to survive on their own, cut off from the rest of the known universe.

As fear of the Blobs and resentment of their colonies’ seeming abandonment by the rest of humanity spiraled, Bowerson’s “Machine Cult” took power in a near bloodless coup. The focus of Bowerson’s movement became building a highly mechanized space navy of a size that far exceeded the size of a traditional space navy that their population would normally have been able to support. Thanks to the massive quantities of mineral resources and manufacturing on these two colonies, this turned out to be more achievable than any so called “experts” from the rest of human space would have anticipated.

As they pushed to quickly build up their navy, they began to suffer sporadic Blob attacks. This environment of threat and desperation helped lead to a culture of military focus and of dedication to the goals of the cult. The Cult preached survival through technology, which eventually led to worship of technology itself. Over time, the Machine Cult expanded to other nearby worlds and the reasons for starting the cult faded, while dedication and fervor for its ideals increased.

In recent years the Machine Cult has come into contact with the rest of humanity, but shown no interest in becoming a member of either the Trade Federation or the Star Empire, despite pressure from both of those parties to do so. While they lag behind the other major star realms in population, the Machine Cult makes up for it with a technologically advanced, relatively large and largely automated space navy, as well as with their religious and military zeal.

Given the success of the Machine Cult and The Star Empire with breaking free from the Trade Federation and creating their own independent political entities in spite of and in part because of The Blobs, sometimes others are tempted to try and carve out their own star realms on the outer edges of settled space. This is usually only possible with the cooperation of or at least the tolerance of one or more of the existing factions.
As trade intensifies and colonists and settlers are enticed away from the existing star realms, friction inevitably happens, sometimes with the four main star realms and always with other new, competing, emergent realms. War soon follows. So far no new star realms have emerged successfully since the Machine Cult, but that doesn’t stop people from trying. Even various factions from within Blob space have been known to throw their lot in with humans seeking a new start and a new realm. Space is vast, but good colony worlds and worlds with good natural resources are at a premium.

5514,Mystery Case Files: Dire Grove,"Mystery Case Files: Dire Grove is an interactive movie puzzle adventure game developed by Big Fish Studios, and distributed by Big Fish Games. It is the sixth installment in the Mystery Case Files series. The game is available exclusively at Big Fish Games website. The Mystery Case Files franchise is the number one brand in casual games and has sold more than 2.5 million units to date.","This story takes place directly after the events in Mystery Case Files: Return to Ravenhearst. The player is driving through a decrepit town called Dire Grove, which appears to be deserted. The weather forecast has predicted a heavy snowstorm and the player has no other option but to explore the deserted town for shelter. The player sees an abandoned car and finds a camcorder in it. The footage shows a teenaged girl crying and pleading the player to save them. The player also finds a cryptic note: ""She is real. The legend is real."".
As the player explores the surrounding, they realize that all the villagers have evacuated due to the snowstorm, so the player has to do everything by themself. The player learns that the girl in the footage is Alison Sterling, a collegiate who has chosen the Celtic legend of the Banshee as a subject for research. She arrived here with 3 friends and all four of them are missing. The player also learns that Dr. Patricia Anderson, an archaeologist had unearthed some relics only some days ago.
The player eventually learns about the legend of the Banshee. Apparently a farmer, a fisherman, a hunter and a blacksmith performed a ritual 1000 years ago to open a portal to talk to their kin in the spirit world. When the dead started attacking the living, they offered a young woman to appease the ghosts and close the portal. This woman became the Banshee and is trying to come back. The player also find that all the students have been subdued and hypnotized by the Banshee. Dr. Anderson's recording proves that the relics unearthed by her are maybe the keys to the portal.
The player is left with only one option: open the portal and send the Banshee back to the spirit world. Only after opening the portal the player realizes that the Banshee has tricked them into freeing her spirit. The player races against time, trapping the Banshee's spirit again and saved the students. In the end, Alison gives a lecture about the events at Dire Grove, where she is given by a big applause by a huge number of audience, including her friends. An audience member asks her about your identity, but she says: ""That person has asked to remain nameless, but I can give you their business card.""

New Arkham City inmate and rising warlord, Two-Face devises a plan to publicly execute fellow prisoner Catwoman after she tries to steal back some of her ill-gotten gains from his hideout. Meanwhile, Gotham City itself has degenerated into a police state managed by Mayor Sharp, where citizens with the slightest trace of a criminal record find themselves shipped to the prison district. Those who dare to challenge Sharp's policies are the target of arranged disappearances, becoming political prisoners trapped behind Arkham's walls. Among these is Bruce Wayne, who holds a rally attacking the proposal of turning half his city into a walled-off reserve for criminally inclined persons. Segregated from society, he argues, they have become responsible for their own survival in an anarchic urban hell which is characterized by bloody gang wars.

Welcome to Arkham City
Wayne, as the latest focus of Sharp's vendetta, is kidnapped by TYGER Security operatives working for Hugo Strange, who is privy to his dual identity as Batman. Strange intends to unveil new plans for Arkham City before the night is up, an operation codenamed Protocol 10, which will establish himself as supreme ruler of Gotham. Now an inmate, the Dark Knight manages to have Alfred Pennyworth deliver his crimefighting equipment to him directly via an airdrop, and he prepares to save Catwoman from Two-Face for the sake of their past relationship while uncovering the true nature of Protocol 10.","Action, Stealth, Open world","batman, based on - comics, catwoman, dick grayson","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2kia.jpg,93.35178053169697,"https://store.steampowered.com/app/200260, https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/batman-arkham-city/home, https://rocksteadyltd.com/#arkham-city, https://www.twitch.tv/rocksteady, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzi3f1gdbL-rDLUHFxq1GpA, https://www.facebook.com/BatmanArkhamUK, https://twitter.com/batmanarkham, https://www.instagram.com/batmanarkham, https://www.reddit.com/r/BatmanArkham, https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City, https://www.gog.com/game/batman_arkham_city_goty"

112875,God of War Ragnarök,"God of War: Ragnarök is the ninth installment in the God of War series and the sequel to 2018's God of War. Continuing with the Norse mythology theme, the game is set in ancient Norway and features series protagonists Kratos, the former Greek God of War, and his young son Atreus. The game kicked off the events of Ragnarök, where Kratos and Atreus must journey to each of the Nine Realms in search of answers as they prepare for the prophesied battle that will end the world.","The freezing winds of Fimbulwinter have come to Midgard, making survival for Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir in the Norse wilds even more challenging than before.

While the last game built an enormous amount of trust and understanding between father and son, there is still a great deal of complexity in their interactions – especially after the revelation of Atreus’ Giant heritage and the hidden prophecy only Kratos saw.

Atreus is desperately curious. Like most young people, he wants to understand who he is more than anything. In this case, he wants to understand who he could be. The mystery of Loki’s role in the upcoming conflict is something that Atreus cannot let go of. He wants to keep his family safe, but Atreus also doesn’t want to stand by and do nothing while conflict consumes the Nine Realms.

Kratos, still bearing the knowledge of his past mistakes, wants to spare Atreus the bloody lessons he learned from his conflict with gods. He wants to keep his son safe, above all, and their confrontation with Baldur has vindicated the belief that only tragedy will come from further entanglements with the Aesir.

Together, Kratos and Atreus will have to make a choice about which path they will take. Whatever they choose will define the fate of all those living in the Nine Realms as Ragnarök approaches.","Action, Fantasy, Historical, Open world","greek mythology, exploration, story driven, norse mythology, dark fantasy, upgradable weapons, cinematic, mythology, hand-to-hand combat, multiple endings, combat, over the shoulder, dwarves, emotional, gods, trolls, questing, skill tree, greek alphabet, narrative, norse, thor, zeus, kratos, father and son relationship","Role-playing (RPG), Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co5s5v.jpg,92.06559882407637,"https://godofwar.playstation.com/, https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/God_of_War_Wiki, https://www.facebook.com/godofwar, https://twitter.com/sonysantamonica, https://instagram.com/santamonicastudio, https://www.youtube.com/user/PlayStation/search, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War:_Ragnar%C3%B6k, https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/God%20of%20War%3A%20Ragnarok, https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok, https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/, https://epicgames.com/product/god-of-war-ragnarok-3ca641"

The game incorporates elements of wuxia, shenmo and fantasy. Since its release in 1995, the game has spawned a successful video game franchise in Taiwan and mainland China. It was also adapted into the 2005 Chinese television series Chinese Paladin.","There are many subtle differences between the numerous versions of the game. The plot provided in this section is based on the PC game versions for Windows 95 and 98.

The protagonist, Li Xiaoyao(李逍遥), is an ordinary 19-year-old boy who lives in a small fishing village near Suzhou(苏州), China. During a quest to seek a cure for his ill aunt, he travels to a strange island out at sea, where he meets a fairy named Zhao Ling'er(赵灵儿). He is forced to marry her and remain on the island forever, but manages to escape home with the cure for his aunt. However, he loses memory of his adventure on the island and does not remember Zhao when he meets her again. This time, Zhao's home has been destroyed by some enemies and Li decides to accompany her to southwestern China to find her mother, who may still be alive.

Li and Zhao arrive in Suzhou and meet Lin Yueru(林月如), the spoiled daughter of a wealthy martial artist. Unexpectedly, Li emerges as champion in a martial arts contest and wins Lin's hand-in-marriage. Li and Lin are engaged but Zhao disappears mysteriously on their wedding night and they set of to find her. Their search brings them to Sichuan(四川), where the Mount Shu Sect(蜀山仙剑派), a powerful martial arts clan, is based. They learn that Zhao is actually a half-serpent spirit and has been imprisoned inside the Demon Prison Tower(锁妖塔) by the sect's elders. Li and Lin break into the tower and succeed in rescuing Zhao after making a perilous descent to its lowest level, but suffer grave injuries when the tower collapses on itself during their escape.

The trio are saved by a herbal medicine guru, who tells Li that Zhao is pregnant with his child, and that Lin has died from her wounds. Li is deeply saddened but he has a more important task to do, which is, to retrieve two rare items to save Zhao and his baby's lives. During his quest, he meets and befriends A'nu(阿奴), a white Miao(苗族) princess. They are currently in southwestern China, where the Miao people live. The land is plagued by a prolonged drought and the white and black Miao are at war over scarce resources. Li completes his mission and Zhao recovers, after which she calls for a rainstorm and restores peace to the land. They discover that the drought is orchestrated by an evil black Miao cleric. Li, Zhao and A'nu confront him and manage to defeat him after a battle, but Zhao sacrifices herself to destroy a monster summoned by the cleric.

Li is traumatized by the loss of his two close friends, who are also his love interests. He bids A'nu farewell and walks away alone. Just then, he sees Lin, carrying his child. Lin's reappearance at the end of the game is often disputed, but the official story released by the producers claim that Lin is indeed dead and cannot be resurrected. However, her body may be brought back to life, but she will never be the same as before because her soul is dead.","Fantasy, Drama, Romance","magic, 2d, turn-based, female protagonist, combat, story rich, 2d platformer, colorful, party-based rpg",Role-playing (RPG),//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co57ln.jpg,93.3137721118778,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Sword_and_Fairy_(video_game), https://store.steampowered.com/app/1546570, http://pal.softstargames.com.tw/zh-tw/portfolio/more?gid=39, https://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Sword_and_Fairy, https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/The%20Legend%20of%20Sword%20and%20Fairy/, https://twitter.com/swordandfairy"

79341,Super Robot Taisen W,Super Robot Wars W is part of the Super Robot Wars franchise and was published for the Nintendo DS by Banpresto. It is the first Super Robot Wars game released for the Nintendo DS.,"Space Calendar (SC) 99. In the previous age, the governments of Earth formed the Federated Earth Nation (FEN) to bring World War III to an end. After putting down the defiant lunar colony, the Federation Space Calendar was instituted. To alleviate environmental pressures and overpopulation, the FEN began expanding into space, constructing space colonies and asteroid cities, as well as an Orbital Space Ring around the Earth, and the development and terraforming of the Moon and Mars. This was accomplished in a short time, due to quantum leaps in physics and energy research.

But repression of those living in the colonies by the FEN ignited a war between factions in space, and OZ, the true leaders of the FEN. This ""Revolutionary War"" ended in the year 98, with the death of FEN President Treize Khushrenada. From Treize's will, a New United Nations was formed, returning power back to the individual states.

But the new Earth Sphere's troubles seemed to multiply. The Earth Sphere was invaded by the Radam, who seized control of the Orbital Space Ring, and the invaders known as the Jovian Lizards, who destroyed the Mars Colony. In addition, internal strife, such as the arbitrary distinction between Coordinators and Naturals, and mechanized terrorism, seem to be taking the New United Nations to the breaking point.

- Content previously missing from the North American release
- PlayStation Network Trophies
- 3D support.","Ico:
Ico (イコ, pronounced ""Ee-ko""), a horned boy, is taken by a group of warriors to an abandoned castle and locked inside a stone coffin to be sacrificed. A tremor topples the coffin and Ico escapes. As he searches the castle, he comes across Yorda (ヨルダ, Yoruda), a captive girl who speaks a different language. Ico helps Yorda escape and defends her from shadow-like creatures. The pair makes their way through the castle and arrive at the bridge leading to land. As they cross, the Queen, ruler of the castle, appears and tells Yorda that as her daughter she cannot leave the castle. Later, as they try to escape on the bridge, it splits up and they get separated. Yorda tries to save Ico but the Queen prevents it. He ends up falling off the bridge and losing consciousness.

Ico awakens below the castle and makes his way back to the upper levels, finding a magic sword that dispels the shadow creatures. After discovering that Yorda has been turned to stone by the Queen, he confronts the Queen in her throne room, who reveals that she plans to restart her life anew by taking possession of Yorda's body. Ico slays the Queen with the magic sword, but his horns are broken in the fight and at the end of it he is knocked unconscious. With the Queen's death the castle begins to collapse around Ico, but the Queen's spell on Yorda is broken, and a shadowy Yorda carries Ico safely out of the castle to a boat, sending him to drift to the shore alone.

A moment later, several humanoid shadow creatures appear and approach Wander before he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as ""Dormin"" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which Dormin states may be possible on the condition that Wander can destroy the sixteen idols lining the temple's hall by using the ancient sword to kill each colossus the idols represent located throughout the land. Despite being warned by Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them.","Action, Fantasy, Drama, Open world","kaiju, bundle","Simulator, Adventure",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4ako.jpg,89.15626811116567,"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNQBbGnXiwbDropHXXEazLA, https://www.facebook.com/SonyJapanStudio, https://twitter.com/SonyJapanStudio, https://teamico.fandom.com/wiki/The_ICO_and_Shadow_of_the_Colossus_Collection, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ico_%26_Shadow_of_the_Colossus_Collection"

1691,Advance Wars,"Just because this battle fits in the palm of your hand doesn't mean the stakes are small. On the contrary, this all-or-nothing fight will have you accessing guns, grenades, launchers, and weaponry of all sorts. Players assume command of an army that's out to reclaim a world that's been broken up by warring factions. The battle map is essentially a grid, and moving units is like moving chess pieces on a board -- each of the units can move a specific amount of spaces within this grid, and can only attack at a certain distance from specific enemies. Advance Wars features more than 115 maps, a map editor, head-to-head play via link cable, and an easy-to-understand tutorial mode for beginners.","The story of the Advance Wars begins in the ""Field Training"" tutorial mode, with the nation of Orange Star in a war against the neighboring nation of Blue Moon, with Olaf as the Blue Moon Army commanding officer (CO). Olaf suddenly ordered an invasion of the Orange Star nation and is in battle with the Orange Star Army. The campaign continues the story that started in the tutorial. Nell, the de facto leader of the Orange Star COs, gives the player the duty of a tactical advisor for the Orange Star Army.

The player follows the war effort through all four countries, with its own COs, over the course of the game. Starting with having only one choice of a CO to advise, Andy, the player will have a choice of two more Orange Star COs, Max and Sami, to advise as the story progresses, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Depending on which CO is chosen by the player to advise, there are times when a mission is split into a choice of two or three, where the maps and dialog could be different. After completing that mission, the story paths could split up, depending on which CO was chosen in that previous mission, with the story differing from the other path, eventually leading back to the main path.

After winning a battle against Green Earth, Andy gets mysteriously accused by Green Earth's CO, Eagle, of committing a treacherous act of aggression against Green Earth. After defeating the Blue Moon troops that invaded the Orange Star country, the Orange Star Army then invade the Blue Moon country, defeating their troops. The Blue Moon COs, Olaf and Grit, are revealed to be COs whom both used to work for the Orange Star Army, but switched to Blue Moon. When the Orange Star Army's intention was to just pass through the other two countries, Green Earth and Yellow Comet, the countries' COs like Kanbei of Yellow Comet assume a threat of an invasion and declare battles against the Orange Star Army in their land.

Later on, Green Earth CO Drake tells Eagle that the Orange Star Army didn't attack Green Earth, saying that ""This entire conflict has been orchestrated from the beginning."" Meanwhile, Yellow Comet CO Sonja and Grit try to discover the person who is really behind the attacks. When Eagle meets Andy again, Eagle again accuses Andy of attacking Green Earth, to which the Orange Star COs eventually convince Eagle that it wasn't Andy who attacked Green Earth. This explains why the three nations have been declaring battles against Orange Star, as they thought Andy attacked them first.

When Eagle meets Sonja, Sonja also tells Eagle that Andy wasn't behind the attacks, saying it was someone else, and goes with her to see what she discovered. It is revealed that the enigmatic Black Hole Army, under the command of Sturm, is the true enemy. Using a CO doppelganger clone of Andy, Sturm stirred up war among the four countries in order to confuse, weaken, and eventually conquer them. Once this is revealed, the four countries unite to drive Black Hole out of their land, the Cosmo Land, with COs automatically chosen depending on the paths the player took during the game.","Action, Science fiction, Warfare","modern warfare, helicopter, anime, mech, turn-based, soldier, battleship, turn-based tactics, pixel art, tank, grid-based movement, airplane, explosion, digital distribution, tactical turn-based combat, rivaling factions, modern military, ranking system, love triangle, virtual console, unlockables, red vs blue, non-player character, a.i. companion, stat tracking, in-game map editor, clone, submarine, not-so-bad guys, movement penalty, naval warfare, no blood, e3 2001, interactive achievement awards 2002, wii u virtual console, fan translation - portuguese","Simulator, Strategy, Turn-based strategy (TBS), Tactical",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co25mi.jpg,84.14635602127359,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars, https://warswiki.org/wiki/Advance_Wars_(game), https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Game-Boy-Advance/Advance-Wars-866532.html, https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Advance%20Wars"

You have attempted to hack into the TriOptimum Corporation Network, and gain unauthorized access to protected files concerning the Space Station Citadel. Unfortunately, your hacking attempts have been detected, and your location is soon tracked.

He will drop all charges against you, if you hack into SHODAN, the artificial intelligence that controls Citadel Station. You will also gain a military grade neuro interface if you are successful. Naturally, you agree to this offer, and Edward Diego gives you Level 1 access to SHODAN. You receive your neuro implant, and undergo a 6-month healing coma.

The game starts when you awake from your coma. But somehow, things are not quite how you remember them. You find an audio log (as well as some other goodies) hidden in a cupboard. The log is from Rebecca Lansing, who is a TriOptimum counter terrorism consultant based on Earth. She tells you that they have detected a disruption on Citadel Station, and that a mining beam is preparing to fire at Earth. Since you are the only contact between Earth and Citadel Station, it is up to you to find out what is going on.

68,Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares,Master of Orion 2 also known as MOO2 is considered the classic 4x turn based strategy game set in space. The game has a kind of cult status and even by to days standards is still only matched in game play by very few of its competitors.,"Long before the time in which the game is set, two extremely powerful races, the Orions and the Antarans, fought a war that devastated most of the galaxy. The victorious Orions, rather than exterminate the Antarans, imprisoned them in a pocket dimension before departing the galaxy, leaving behind a very powerful robotic warship, the Guardian, to protect their homeworld.
Some time after the game starts, the Antarans, having broken out of their prison dimension, begin to send increasingly powerful fleets against the players' colonies, to destroy them rather than to invade. The only way they can be stopped is to carry the battle to their home universe through a Dimensional Portal.","Science fiction, 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate)","aliens, space strategy, space","Strategy, Turn-based strategy (TBS)",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co2fhi.jpg,92.00819725177263,"https://store.steampowered.com/app/410980, https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Master%20of%20Orion%20II:%20Battle%20at%20Antares, https://www.gog.com/game/master_of_orion_1_2, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion_II%3A_Battle_at_Antares, http://www.masteroforion.com"

The gameplay of Ocarina of Time was revolutionary for its time, it has arguably made more of an impact on later games in the series than any of its predecessors even though they had the same cores of exploration, dungeons, puzzles and item usage. Among the gameplay mechanics, one of the most noteworthy is the time-traveling system. The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well and each of them has certain unique abilities. Ocarina of Time also introduces the use of music to solve puzzles: as new songs are learned, they can be used to solve puzzles, gain access to new areas and warp to different locations. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games but they are not too complex.","A young boy named Link was raised in the village of the elf-like Kokiri people. One day a fairy named Navi introduces him to the village's guardian, the Great Deku Tree. It appears that a mysterious man has cursed the tree, and Link is sent to the Hyrule Castle to find out more.

- The four-mission Season of Infamy: Most Wanted DLC
- Batgirl’s Arkham Asylum prequel A Matter of Family DLC
- Robin’s A Flip of a Coin DLC
- And the brand new Batman v Superman Batmobile Pack!

For PlayStation owners, Batman Arkham Knight offers the exclusive Scarecrow Nightmare Pack, in which Gotham falls victim to Scarecrow's fear toxin, transforming the famous city into a twisted, hellish nightmare. Tear through the city in the all-new Batmobile and face off against a towering vision of Scarecrow and his undead army as they spread terror on the streets.","Prologue
Nine months after the |Joker's death, crime rates in Gotham City have dramatically declined, but Batman anticipates a new threat and maintains a vigil over the city. Before his death, the Joker sent his mutated blood to Gotham's hospitals, and several patients were infected. While most were cured, the patients who were not treated are starting to look and act like the Joker. Batman researches a cure for the mutations, and orders Robin to watch over the infected.

The Arkham Knight
On Halloween night, Scarecrow unleashes his newest strain of Fear Gas in a diner, and threatens to release it throughout Gotham. Six million civilians are evacuated, but the city's criminals and supervillains stay behind, leaving Commissioner James Gordon and the Gotham City Police Department outnumbered. Batman investigates Scarecrow's presence, and searches for him in a rooftop safehouse, but instead finds and saves Poison Ivy, who was being held captive by Scarecrow's henchmen. In a makeshift Batcave in Gotham's Clock Tower, Barbara Gordon is collecting information on Scarecrow's new toxin, and traces its production to Ace Chemicals. Batman goes to investigate, but is confronted by the mysterious ""Arkham Knight"" and his militia, which has a massive army of unmaned tanks. Batman fights his way through the militia, learning from workers that Scarecrow is planning to produce a chemical explosion so large that it will cover the entire eastern seaboard in fear toxin. Batman reaches Scarecrow, who reveals to him that Barbara has been abducted by the Arkhan Knight before escaping. While reducing the blast radius, Batman is exposed to the fear toxin, which reacts with his own mutated blood to cause hallucinations of the Joker. Escaping from the exploding Ace Chemicals, Batman is forced to tell Gordon about his daughter's involvement in his crime-fighting, and the outraged Gordon swears that he will find Barbara without Batman's help.

Scarecrow's Plans
Batman tracks the Arkham Knight to an underground tunnel network, hoping to learn Barbara's whereabouts from him, but instead gets ambushed by him. Batman then gives chase to the escaping convoy, only to learn that the driver is a decoy, using a voice synthesizer that makes him sound like the Arkham Knight. Batman interrogates the driver and learns that they are heading to the North Refrigeration. He and Nightwing interrogate the Penguin, who tells them that the Knight and Scarecrow are meeting with a businessman named Simon Stagg, who runs a pharmaceutical company. After boarding Stagg's airship, Batman discovers that Scarecrow paid Stagg to create a device known as the ""Cloudburst"", but Stagg tried to double-cross them and has been doused with fear toxin as punishment. After reaching Scarecrow and interrogating Stagg, Batman is again exposed to the toxin, which triggers a powerful hallucinogenic response. Scarecrow escapes with the Cloudburst. Batman receives a message from Scarecrow revealing that Barbara is in the same safehouse where Ivy was held, but before Batman can save her, Barbara is doused with fear toxin and shoots herself in the head. Batman and Alfred Pennyworth are devastated, but Alfred convinces Batman to not lose hope, for Barbara's sake. Alfred explains to Batman that the Cloudburst is a dispersal device designed to flood all of Gotham with the fear toxin. To counteract this effect, Batman enlists the help of Ivy, who takes control of a large tree which develops giant flowers capable of neutralizing the toxin.","Action, Thriller, Stealth, Drama, Open world","batman, based on - comics, catwoman, dick grayson, jason todd","Fighting, Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co7xja.jpg,91.42183171317467,"https://rocksteadyltd.com/#arkham-knight, https://www.twitch.tv/rocksteady, https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzi3f1gdbL-rDLUHFxq1GpA, https://www.facebook.com/BatmanArkhamUK, https://twitter.com/batmanarkham, https://www.instagram.com/batmanarkham, https://www.reddit.com/r/BatmanArkham, https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Knight, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Knight"

136790,Multi-Users in Middle-earth,"MUME, Multi-Users in Middle-earth, is a DikuMUD based upon J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth that has been continuously running, enhanced, and remastered since fall of 1991. In MUME, players are encouraged to role-play as they live in this meticulously crafted world exploring the conflict leading into the War of the Ring during the late Third Age. The action takes place nearly 100 years prior to The Hobbit but long after the loss of the One Ring by Sauron. The key to Erebor has just been found by Gandalf in Dol Guldur and all the epic tales narrated in The Lord of the Rings may take place.

MUME covers 28,000+ original rooms from the mighty Dwarven Halls beyond the Gulf of the Lhûn in the West to the Mountains of Mirkwood in the East, and from the ruins of Fornost Erain in the North to the fortress of Isengard in the South.

Players can choose among several different races, each with some unique characteristics. The races are separated into three striving factions. Dwarves, Elves, Half-Elves, Hobbits and Men — among them are the shapeshifting Beornings — are eternally at war with the Orcs, Trolls and Black Númenóreans. Moreover, the orkish tribe of the Zaugurz is trying to expand its territory at the expense of the Tarkhnarb Orcs of Goblin Gate. Most of this conflict takes place to the east and south of the town of Bree, but rare raids or solitary agents of the Red Eye have made it to as far west as the Dwarven homes in the Blue Mountains.","MUME has been around a number of years and has a lot of interesting features. It has thousands of rooms, covering the Blue Mountains in the west, the Grey Havens, Bree, the Shire, Fornost in the north, Tharbad in the south, Rivendell, the Misty Mountains, the Carrock and Lórien to the east. There are other places such as the dreaded Mines of Moria, the Orc Caves, the dark and ancient Old Forest, the forest of Mirkwood, the mysterious forest Fangorn and the Troll Warrens.

You can meet a lot of interesting people, such as the elves Cirdan, Elrond, Arwen, Celeborn or Galadriel, the leader of the Istari-Council Saruman, the mean trolls Bill, Bert and Tom or you can just buy a beer in Barliman's famous Inn. The mysterious Tom Bombadil sings his songs in the Old Forest, in which Old Man Willow has taken its roots long ago. And deep down in the earth, in the deepest mines of Moria, you may find a horror that was forgotten a long time ago. You will also meet many others from whom you heard the one or other tale or who are new to you.

You also can solve many quests. You can open ancient dwarven tombs or help a poor shopkeeper find something he lost, defeat fearsome enemies and search for ancient lore. Explore long forgotten towers and hidden places or just lean back with a good beer and listen to the one or other story, told by one of the storytellers.

999,Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee,"Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee is the first game set in the fictional Oddworld universe. It is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements, focusing on the portrayal of a weak, underpowered character in a grim and hostile world, who has to rely on his cunning to outwit enemies and overcome hazards. The game has pre-rendered background graphics and uses CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.

The main character Abe is almost completely helpless: he cannot use weapons and is usually instantly killed by his brutal enemies if he confronts them directly. For this reason, most of the game involves careful exploration, timed movement, sneaking, and outsmarting the foes through various means: throwing stones to confuse them, luring them into traps, etc. Abe can run, jump, climb, tiptoe, crouch, and roll; in most areas these actions are essential to his survival. A few stages involve Abe riding a large animal known as Elum.

Abe's only special power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while or possess them. When Abe possess an enemy he gains his abilities: for example, possessing the body or a ferocious Slig allows the player to shoot from his machine gun, communicate with other creatures of his kind, and even commit suicide, clearing the way for Abe.","Abe is a Mudokon, a member of a once prosperous race which has now been enslaved by the Glukkons, forced to work in their huge corporations. The food factories have found a new type of meat, delicious to all the inhabitants, though no one knows the recipe. Following his stomach, Abe eavesdrops on the corporate leaders' conversation, and makes the most frightening and disgusting discovery: his own race is that secret delicious food. Alas, Abe has been spotted, and the guards are marching towards him. He must escape, but he can't leave his friends to the mercy of the Glukkons and their henchmen. He must rescue as many as he can, and tell the world the truth about what he has found out.","Action, Science fiction, Stealth, Comedy","exploration, cyberpunk, dystopian, death, 2.5d, action-adventure, side-scrolling, steam, multiple endings, traps, dark humor, slavery, playstation network, possession, darkness, explosion, digital distribution, single-player only, anthropomorphism, playstation mobile, voice acting, developer voice acting, mind control, psone classics, breaking the fourth wall, original soundtrack release, sprinting mechanics, playstation plus, escort mission, resistance, xbox live, blindness, shaky camera, liberation, no hud, onlive, sleeping enemies, genocide, falling object, on-the-fly character switching, flip screen, pre-rendered backgrounds, real-time over pre-rendered movies, greatest hits, backwards compatibility, promo vhs, e3 1997, playstation underground, psvita","Platform, Puzzle, Adventure",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co89fk.jpg,82.39456537938264,"https://store.steampowered.com/app/15700, http://www.oddworld.com/?p=68, https://www.gog.com/game/oddworld_abes_oddysee, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oddworld:_Abe%27s_Oddysee, https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Oddworld:%20Abe's%20Oddysee"

More than just a side-scrolling fighting game, River City Ransom EX features a character-building system and customization options.

The Western version is a regional port of the Japanese version, since it uses the same storyline and identities of River City Ransom, instead of the stablished characters from Downtown Nekketsu Story and the Kunio-kun franchise.","Several months after Kunio defeated Sabu and rescued Hiroshi, twin brothers Ryuuichi and Ryuuji Hattori transfer to Reihou Academy. Within a few months, the brothers take control of the neighboring high schools using powerful fighting techniques, striking fear as the ""Double Dragon Brothers"". Riki, the banchou of Hanazono High School has no interest in the brothers or what they have been doing. But one day his girlfriend Mami goes missing and he receives a challenge from the academy.

You're going into combat against the best the enemy can offer, but you've got the most advanced fighting helicopter in the world at your fingertips, packed with a devastating array of lethal weapons and state-of-the art technology.

You're ready to rock and roll but so is the enemy! They're waiting for you with combat helicopters of their own, backed up by radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and missiles and fixed wing aircraft. It's not going to be a cakewalk but you and your Apache are up to the challenge. Across four theaters of war-- Fort Hood where you train and then in war zones in Cyprus, Yemen, and Korea--you will fly the most fearsome helicopter that has ever been designed against enemies on land, sea, and air.

Apache Longbow took flying simulators to the next level. The developers constructed the flight model with fanatical attention to detail, going so far as to bring in Apache pilots to fly the in-game chopper and offer their feedback on how real the experience felt. Every flight simulator enthusiast will be pleased with the complexity and realism this game has to offer. Meanwhile, to make the game more accessible there is also an arcade mode where the flight mechanics aren't nearly as realistic, but there's still tons of fun to be had. So whichever you are - a slow-and-low hardcore sim fan or someone who just likes to fly about and blow things up - this game has something for you.",,Warfare,"modern warfare, helicopter, flight simulator, flight, modern military",Simulator,//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zmaokvadzctygkgessmf.jpg,,"https://www.gog.com/game/apache_longbow, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_(video_game), https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Apache"

King Rodrick, aided by the forbidden powers of the ""Palace of the Dead,"" is able to dominate the people of Valeria until Dorgalua of Bakram successfully leads his army to defeat Rodrick. Dorgalua then claimed the throne as his own, and was able to end the struggle between the ethnic groups. Under King Dorgalua, the rights of the people were preserved, and all internal struggles in Valeria came to a temporary halt.
All is right until the entire royal family is lost due to a string of accidents. Because the late King Dorgalua had no living heirs, the ethnic groups once again struggled for leadership: Abuna Brantyn of the royal court, Heirophant Balbatos of the Galgastani, and Duke Ronwey of the Walister all fought for control, but in the end, Balbatos and Brantyn stalemated. In order to preserve their power, the two men took separate measures: Heirophant Balbatos sought an ""ethnic cleansing"" policy and slaughtered thousands of innocent Walister and Galgastani, while Brantyn received aid from foreigners, the Dark Knights Loslorien of the Holy Lodis Empire.

Olympus and the dark depths of Hell to seek revenge on those who have betrayed him. Armed with double-chained blades, and an array of new weapons and magic for this iteration of the trilogy, Kratos must take on mythology's darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles throughout his merciless quest to destroy Olympus. Utilizing a new game engine built from the ground up and state-of-the-art visual technologies, the development team behind God of War III has made standard-setting strides in giving players the realistic feel of actually being on the battlegrounds. With texture resolutions quadrupling since God of War II on PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system, God of War III, in its debut on the PS3 system, will feature fluid, life-like characters, as well as dynamic lighting effects, a robust weapon system, and world-changing scenarios that will truly bring unmistakable realism to Kratos' fateful quest. Players will have a chance to join battles on a grand scale that is four times larger than its predecessor.","Following the ending of God of War II, God of War III picks up directly after this with a stirring opening narration from Zeus discussing the actions of the rogue Kratos, who is 'commanding' a small army of Titans rescued from the Great War (using the power of the Fates). The Olympians immediately rush to battle; Helios rides on his chariot over Olympus, Hermes speeds down the very peaks of Olympus as Zeus watches on, Hercules receives the order to lead his troops down into the fray, Hades lunges off and engages several Titans in his giant form, and Poseidon (using his aquakinesis) shoots down from Olympus like a missile and performs a death blow through the chest of Epimetheus, and then manifests himself as a massive water being and spawns several water horses called Hippocampi to aid in the battle. With Poseidon as their greatest threat in the battle, having already decimated numerous Titans and soon going after Gaia herself, Kratos engages the God of the Sea and after drawing him into Gaia's grasp manages to knock a weakened Poseidon out of his godly form and onto a separate platform. The two quarrel with each other briefly before Kratos walks up and beats the Lord of the Sea savagely, finally gouging out his eyes and snapping his neck before he tosses him into the ocean. With Poseidon's death, the seas cataclysm and ocean levels rise significantly, causing a flood that appears to engulf the entire world and destroying almost all of mankind save those on top of Olympia.","Action, Fantasy, Historical","greek mythology, bloody, murder, magic, death, horse, maze, mythology, action-adventure, religion, steam, achievements, undead, portals, revenge, nudity, sequel, climbing, swimming, sword & sorcery, giants, gods, one-man army, darkness, boss fight, fixed camera, explosion, block puzzle, single-player only, platform exclusive, playstation trophies, alternate costumes, 60 fps on consoles, voice acting, human, polygonal 3d, skill points in game, bow and arrow, upgradeable weapons, rat, photo mode, collectibles, special attacks, full motion video, original soundtrack release, unlockables, extreme violence, centaurs, minotaurs, escort mission, melee, real-time combat, stat tracking, instant kill, shielded enemies, wilhelm scream, post-credits plot twist, pack-in game, rpg elements, mercenary, falling sequence, cross culture language skills, villain, anti-hero, been here before, unlockable difficulty level, suicide, banshee, particle system, pre-order exclusive, quick time event, cutscene pause, unskippable cutscene, unskippable intro movies, linear gameplay, gliding, gore system, finishing move, in-game moves list, scripted events, fire manipulation, aggressive door-opening, superpowers, strategic dismemberment, sibling rivalry, censored version, context sensitive, reversible cover art, counter system, sociopathy, petrification, bad parents, trilogy, second person perspective, playstation home tie-in, tragic hero, crowd control, heroic sacrifice, health from romance, dark past, greatest hits, white magic, monologue, off-camera death, fury, bangsian fantasy, easy mode, divine punishment, inner-thoughts world, sixaxis support, on disc dlc, interactive achievement awards 2011, e3 2009, tokyo game show 2009, pax 2009, e3 2008, gamescom 2009, spike video game awards 2009, male protagonist, sexual themes","Hack and slash/Beat 'em up, Adventure",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co3koi.jpg,85.83529977744271,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_III, https://godofwar.playstation.com/, https://godofwar.fandom.com/wiki/God_of_War_III, https://www.facebook.com/godofwar, https://twitter.com/sonysantamonica, https://instagram.com/santamonicastudio, https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/God%20of%20War%20III"

The player can choose to play through six different campaigns telling the story, or play in a scenario against computer or human opponents.","The game's story unfolds primarily through a series of seven playable campaigns, all set upon the continent of Antagarich. During the campaigns, the story is told from alternating points of view, giving players the opportunity to play as each of the town alignments.

Following the disappearance of King Roland Ironfist of Enroth prior to Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven, his wife, Queen Catherine, is left to rule the realm. In the meantime, her father, King Gryphonheart of Erathia, is assassinated. Without their beloved King, the kingdom of Erathia falls to the dark forces of Nighon and Eeofol. Queen Catherine returns home to Antagarich seeking to rally the people of her homeland and lead them against the evil that has ravaged their nation.

Erathia's capital of Steadwick is sacked by the dungeon lords of Nighon and the Kreegans of Eeofol. Meanwhile, the nations of Tatalia and Krewlod skirmish at the western border, seizing the chance to expand their territory. Catherine's first task is to establish a foothold in the conquered kingdom by enlisting the aid of allies. The wizards of Bracada and the elves of AvLee answer her call, and together they push towards Steadwick and eventually retake it, quickly quelling the border war in the west. Soon after, Lucifer Kreegan, a commander in the Eeofol armies, sends an envoy to Erathia claiming that Roland Ironfist is captive within their territories. AvLee invades Eeofol, but fails to rescue Roland, who is transported to their northern holdings. Afterwards, Catherine invades Nighon, pushing the dungeon armies back to their island home.

In the meantime, the necromancers of Deyja, having been responsible for the assassination of King Gryphonheart, plot to revive his corpse as a lich. They plan to use his wisdom in leading their own armies of the undead. However, King Gryphonheart's will proves too much for the necromancers even in his corrupted state, and he becomes a rogue lich. Having little other recourse, Queen Catherine is forced to ally herself with the necromancers and together they set out to destroy the lich of King Gryphonheart before he becomes too powerful.

A final bonus campaign, accessible only after the main campaigns are complete, tells the story of separatists living in the Contested Lands, a war-torn border between Erathia and AvLee. Tired of the skirmishes that bring unrest to their homelands, they join together to fight for independence from the two large kingdoms.

Everything changes, however, one day on the roof, when the class oddball, Aoi, suddenly tries to kiss him. Miyuki appears just in time to stop her, but afterward, Shinichi feels the urge to bring some light to this friendless girl's eyes. He enlists Miyuki's aid, and thus, a trio is born.

The days pass, and little by little, Aoi learns what it means to be friends. But at the same time, long-dormant feelings awaken in Miyuki's heart. As the distance between her and Shinichi shrinks, the hard-earned bonds the three share begin to fray.

86,Dune II: The Building of a Dynasty,"Dune II is often considered the first mainstream modern real-time strategy game and established many conventions of the genre. Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.

The single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.","The Emperor has proposed a challenge, to each of the houses: ""The House that produces the most spice will control Dune. There are no set territories, and no rules of engagement."" Vast armies have arrived. Now, three Houses fight for control of Dune; The Noble Atreides, The Insidious Ordos, The Evil Harkonnen.",Science fiction,"abandonware, futuristic, real-time, religion, war, multiple protagonists, based on - book, tank, capitalism, terraforming, sequel, islam, licensed game, rivaling factions, sequel is in a different genre, buddhism, resource gathering, nuclear bomb, tech trees, regicide, sequel by a different developer, evil empire, galactic empire","Real Time Strategy (RTS), Strategy",//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/co4vw0.jpg,90.06876694654864,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_II, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.morphbot.dune&hl=en_US&gl=US, https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Dune_II, https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Dune%20II:%20The%20Building%20of%20a%20Dynasty"
